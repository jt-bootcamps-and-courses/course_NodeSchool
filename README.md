# NodeSchool.io

This repo contains my answers for course modules from [NodeSchool.io](https://nodeschool.io/)

Pretty neat little course. I like how you run the entire thing in your terminal and text editor. You can run the entire thing without internet once you download the course content package via npm... The JavaScript module made for something fun to do while I was on my last flight.
